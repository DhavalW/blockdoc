# Additional Notes
The goal of St8Flo is to be a unifying platform that combines all manners of distributed computing, ranging from blockchains to bigdata and machine learning, & present them as easy to use API's, that developers can use to build complex reactive distributed system that just work.

Being in Javascript, it is also one of the only few platforms that bring the hottest technologies like Blockchain, distribtued machine learning and analytics, natively to Javascript and 71% of the world's developers.
